Here the materials :
- Arduino Nano x1
- Push Button x4 ( Red, Yellow, Green, Blue )
- Led pin x4 ( Red, Yellow, Green, Blue )
- 7 Segment LCD Display x2
- 74HC595 8bit shift register x2
- Buzzer x1

make sure it's 5V okay, like the standard

here I make the Arduino Nano version of that, and also you can see .cru file, it's for the Crumb Circuit Simulator, just import it to the game

and have fun~
